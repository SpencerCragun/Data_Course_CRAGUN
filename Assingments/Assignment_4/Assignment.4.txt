                                                    **Questions:**

1. What other stuff does read.csv() do automatically?

     It allows for the usage of dataframes and creates a spreadsheet within your R script. 

2. How is it different from read.csv2()?

      This is used with documents that may have used periods instead of commas to seperate their information. Usually in European countries

3. Why does read.csv2() even exist?

     So that the documents mentioned above can still b read into R without having to change all ther periods to commas. 

4. How could I change the parameters of read.csv() to make it so the class of the "State" column is "character" instead of "factor?"

     df$State = as.character(df$State)

5. What command would give the summary stats for ONLY the Home.Value column?

     summary(df$Home.Value)

6. What value is returned by the command: names(df)[4] 

     "Home.Value"

7. What is happening when you add (...col=df\$region) to the above plotting code? 
  In other words, what happens when you run: plot(x=df\$Year,y=df\$Land.Value,col=df\$region)

     It plots the Year vs. Land.Value as well as colors it by region.
